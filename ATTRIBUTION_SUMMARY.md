## How Researchers Should Cite

When using this tool in research, users should:

1. **Cite the original method papers** (provided in CITATIONS.md)
2. **Acknowledge this implementation** (optional)
3. **Reference specific examples** if using verification data

Example:
```
The TOPSIS method (Hwang & Yoon, 1981) was implemented using 
the MCDM Calculator tool, which was verified against standard 
numerical examples from the literature.
```
